# Exercise 4 - Written assignment

In the "Economic inequalities, growth and green economy" and the "Spatial regression" lessons + tutorial 
this week, we went through different indicators that can be used to understand economic inequalities and how 
(spatial) regression models can be used e.g. to understand which factors influence pricing of Airbnb listings. 

For this exercise, we recommend that you first write your text into Google Docs (or some other text editor), and once you are ready, paste the text into this Markdown document located at **your personal copy of the exercise** (e.g. `exercise-1-htenkanen`). You can add your text here using the editing functionalities of GitHub: click the pencil icon on the top-right side of this document (it will start an editor), then modify this document, and commit (i.e. save) your changes (to be able to do that, you need to add a commit message like `Update docs`). 

**Note for those doing the exercise in pairs**:

Only the `code ninja` should be cloning the Exercise repository as she/he/they will the **lead** on this exercise. The `philosopher`, i.e. you who will be leading the work for this written assignment should ask the `code ninja` to provide you [collaboration access](https://docs.github.com/en/github/setting-up-and-managing-your-github-user-account/inviting-collaborators-to-a-personal-repository) to their copy of the Exercise. See more information from the [course page](https://sustainability-gis.readthedocs.io/en/latest/course-info/pair-programming.html).  

## Indicators and spatial regression (10 points)

Write 1-2 pages of text in English where you explain:
 
 - What are the key characteristics of different indicators that aim to measure economic inequality in the world?
 - Why growth/progress indicators that focus purely on economic performance are problematic? 
 - Why is it important to take spatial effects into account when doing regression analysis? 
 - What two approaches did we use to consider spatial effects in the tutorial? How do they differ? 
 
 
Use the lesson materials and the recommended readings (optional) as a source of information for answering to these.
